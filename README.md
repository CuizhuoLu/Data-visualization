# Data-visualization

### Course Learning Outcomes  
1. Draw from a catalog of visual encodings to support specific visual comparisons in temporal, geospatial, 
network, hierarchical, high-dimensional count, text, and uncertain data and demonstrate facility 
implementing them using the R and javascript programming languages.    
2. Draw from a catalog of interactivity patterns to compose visualizations that respond to userâ€™s dynamic 
queries.  
3. Using the vocabulary of data visualization, analyze and critique visual designs. 
4. Given a data analysis problem and initial design solution, iteratively refine visual encodings and 
interactivity idioms from across the design space until a satisfactory solution is discovered.   
5. Navigate the data visualization research literature, summarize the contributions of a specific 
methodological proposal, and evaluate their applicability in specific problem contexts.
